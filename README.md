# unity-netdxf
Taking Reference from https://github.com/haplokuon/netDxf. Have created a DXF Reader only for Unity. Removed all Transform Matrices to flatten the DXF Data.

Will be using FastLineRenderer to draw the dxf data but can't share the plugin here. Please install FastLineRenderer from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/fast-line-renderer-for-unity-gpu-line-and-particle-system-54118
